  "project_description": "This project aims to design and implement a modular, extensible multi-agent AI platform that serves as a meta-agent capable of orchestrating task execution across multiple tools, sub-agents, and external systems. The primary objective is not to build a single-purpose AI assistant, but to create a scalable infrastructure that allows dynamic integration of heterogeneous tools and intelligent delegation of tasks based on contextual analysis, task complexity, and capability matching. The system will function as a unified AI interface capable of handling different categories of user requests, including conversational interaction, structured task planning, and software development orchestration. Rather than solving all tasks directly within a single large language model context, the platform will implement a delegation-first architecture, where complex or domain-specific requests are routed to specialized agents or tool modules. The system must determine whether to process a task internally, delegate it to a sub-agent, invoke a tool, or initiate a multi-agent collaborative workflow. The core innovation of the project lies in the routing and orchestration layer. The platform will include a Master Agent responsible for high-level reasoning and intent interpretation, a Task Classifier that categorizes incoming requests, and a Dispatcher that selects the appropriate execution strategy. The execution layer may include: (1) direct LLM-based processing, (2) tool invocation through a standardized plugin interface, and (3) multi-agent collaboration powered by an external framework such as AutoGen used strictly as an execution engine rather than as the architectural foundation. A central requirement of the system is a plugin-based tool architecture. Tools must be connectable through a clearly defined registration protocol that specifies capabilities, input/output schemas, permission constraints, and failure-handling behavior. The platform must support capability discovery, enabling the Master Agent to query available tools and select them based on declared functionality. For the purposes of this project, only two or three demonstrational tools will be fully implemented (for example, a development-team simulation module and a structured task-management module). The architecture, however, must allow additional tools to be integrated without modification of the core orchestration logic. The system will implement structured context management mechanisms to address LLM context window limitations. This includes short-term conversational memory and persistent structured storage for task states and decision logs. The routing mechanism must account for context size, task complexity, and reasoning depth when determining delegation strategies. Advanced memory optimization techniques or large-scale distributed storage are explicitly outside the initial scope. Error handling and fault tolerance will be implemented at a functional level, including detection of failed tool calls, invalid outputs, and retry or fallback policies. Fully autonomous self-healing systems or large-scale distributed reliability mechanisms are not within the scope of this bachelor-level project. The architectural design will follow a layered structure: user interface layer, orchestration layer (Master Agent, classifier, dispatcher), execution layer (tools and sub-agents), and persistence layer. The implementation must remain modular and provider-agnostic regarding the underlying LLM, but large-scale infrastructure optimization, high-load scaling, or production-grade deployment engineering are explicitly excluded from scope. Formal Scope Boundaries: Development timeline is approximately 12 months, including research, design, implementation, testing, documentation, and thesis preparation. The project will be implemented by a small team (initially three computer science students), with limited development resources. The system will be delivered as a functional prototype, not a production-ready commercial platform. Only a limited number of demonstration tools (2–3) will be fully implemented. Smart home integration and other complex external domains are considered future extensions and are not part of the initial implementation scope. The project will not attempt to replace existing orchestration frameworks but may integrate one (such as AutoGen) as a backend execution engine. The evaluation will focus on architectural correctness, modularity, delegation logic effectiveness, and extensibility rather than market readiness or large-scale deployment performance. Security hardening, enterprise authentication systems, and advanced access control models will be limited to conceptual design and basic implementation only. The project will follow a classical waterfall development model, including requirement specification, system design, implementation, integration testing, system testing, evaluation, and documentation. Agile or continuous deployment methodologies are not part of the formal academic deliverable. The final deliverable is a documented and functional prototype of an extensible AI meta-agent platform with defined APIs for tool integration, implemented routing logic, structured memory handling, and at least two operational demonstration modules that validate delegation and orchestration capabilities. The system is intended as a research-oriented foundation for further development rather than a fully featured universal assistant.",
